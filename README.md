# Tools to make distributed services with celery

The `celery_utils` provides a way to create distributed services. We use the [celery](https://github.com/celery/celery) queue management system, hence the name of our tool.

`celery_utils` package turns any python code into a distributed web service. It allows organising functions into a tree of tasks, where task results are cached in shared storage.

[Wiki](https://github.com/esovetkin/celery-utils/wiki) pages contain detailed documentation and examples.
